        <h1>WELCOME TO MERN STACK DEVELOPMENT</h1>
        <p><b>training is an educational program that focuses 
            on teaching individuals how to develop web applications using a 
            specific technology stack. The MERN stack is an acronym that stands 
            for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. In this training, students learn 
            to build full-stack web applications by mastering each component of the stack, 
            including using MongoDB for database management, Express.js for server-side development,
             React for creating user interfaces, and Node.js for server-side scripting. Through practical 
             exercises and projects, participants gain hands-on experience in developing modern, 
             dynamic web applications.</b> </p>
